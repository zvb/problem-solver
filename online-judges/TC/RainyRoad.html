PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel is going to take a path to meet her friends. The path is tiled with 1x1 square tiles. It is N tiles long and 2 tiles wide. If we imagine that the path is going from the left to the right, we can view it as a rectangle with 2 rows and N columns of tiles.
The rows of the path are numbered 0 to 1 from top to bottom, and the columns of the path are numbered 0 to N-1 from left to right. Ciel starts at the tile in row 0, column 0. She has to reach the tile in row 0, column N-1.

In each step, Ciel can move to an adjacent tile. Two tiles are adjacent if they share at least one point (a side or a corner).

Because it rained yesterday, some tiles are covered by puddles of water. Ciel will not step on these tiles. You are given a vector <string> road. The j-th character of i-th element is 'W' if a tile at i-th row of j-th column is covered by  water, and '.' otherwise.

Return the string "YES" if she can move to her destination without entering a tile which is filled with water. Otherwise, return "NO".

DEFINITION
Class:RainyRoad
Method:isReachable
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:string
Method signature:string isReachable(vector <string> road)


NOTES
-The constraints guarantee that the starting tile and the destination tile are never covered by water.


CONSTRAINTS
-road will contain exactly 2 elements.
-Each elements of road will contain between 2 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-All elements of road will contain the same number of characters.
-Each character of road will be either '.' or 'W'.
-The first character and the last character of 0-th element of road will be '.'.


EXAMPLES

0)
{".W.."
,"...."}

Returns: "YES"

One of the possible ways is as follows. Here, 'F' is the tile occupied by Fox Ciel.

"FW.."
"...."

"F..." 

".W.."
".F.."
